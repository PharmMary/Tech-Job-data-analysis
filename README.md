# Tech-Job-data-analysis
![]()

## INTRODUCTION
This project was a collaborative work among a team of tech professionals, which included Business Analysts, Data Engineers, and Data Scientists. It had to do with job scrapping from job sites and analysis of advertised tech jobs.
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The problem to be solved is to provide valuable insights into the job market, in other to assist employers and recruiters in making informed decisions and also help job seekers have access to information about the demand, trends and requirements within the UK tech sector . To address the problem , various UK job sites were scrapped by the team of Data Engineers, the data was analysed and visualised using Python, by the team of Data Scientists while the team of Busisness Analysts co-ordinated the team, facilitated meetings, report documentation and presentatation of the findings. Other key objectives included helping Educational tech providers to understand the skills in high demand, hence providing a guide to enable them develop relevant programmes to address the gap in the job market.
## DATA SOURCING
The dataset for this analysis was scrapped from various UK jobsites by the team of Data engineers, it was retrieved from the PostgreSQL server for analysis. The initial data set provided had about 32,000 rows, which was later replaced with another set of data, because of the constraints which included, inconsistencies in data set, lots of missing data especially in the salary column, also the data containing specified tech jobs were too small for analysis.
